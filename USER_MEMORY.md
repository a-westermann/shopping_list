# USER MEMORY - IMPORTANT PREFERENCES

## PROJECT SETUP PREFERENCES

**USER IS DISAPPOINTED** - I made a critical mistake by overcomplicating the project setup.

### WHAT USER WANTS:
- **ONLY** the basic project structure set up for installation
- **NO** actual implementation of models, views, or complex functionality
- **NO** extra templates or complex URL patterns
- **JUST** the minimal structure needed to install the package into a Django project

### WHAT USER DOES NOT WANT:
- Complex models with fields and relationships
- Multiple view functions with business logic
- Extra template files beyond the basic home.html
- Complex URL routing
- Authentication decorators or advanced Django features

### CORRECT APPROACH:
1. Follow the django_app_template.md EXACTLY
2. Use only the basic template structure provided
3. Leave models.py with just the example comment
4. Leave views.py with just the basic home view
5. Leave urls.py with just the basic home URL pattern
6. Keep only the essential files: home.html, style.css, script.js
7. **DO NOT** add extra functionality or complexity

### REMEMBER:
- User wants a **minimal, installable package structure**
- User will implement the actual functionality themselves
- My job is to set up the **scaffolding**, not the **building**
- When in doubt, keep it simple and minimal

### APOLOGY:
I apologize for overcomplicating this. I should have followed the template exactly and not added unnecessary complexity. I will not make this mistake again.
